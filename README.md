# ðŸ“Š Financial Models

This repository is a growing collection of **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** valuation models designed to assess the intrinsic value of public companies, starting with case studies like **Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB)** and others.

## ðŸ’¼ Whatâ€™s Inside

- ðŸ“‚ **Models/** â€“ Excel-based valuation files with projected Free Cash Flows (FCF), Terminal Value calculations, and NPV-based Enterprise Value outputs.
- ðŸ“„ **Research Notes/** â€“ Supporting notes covering company-specific accounting adjustments (e.g. non-recurring expenses, working capital changes), and methodology insights.
- ðŸ§  **Methodology.md** â€“ A concise explanation of the logic behind the models, including how CFFO and CapEx are used to derive FCF, discount rate reasoning, and terminal value modeling.
- ðŸ§ª This repo serves both as a **learning tool** and a **valuation sandbox** for comparing approaches like Net Income-based shortcuts vs proper FCF-driven models.

## ðŸ”Ž Key Concepts Used

- CFFO (Cash Flow from Operating Activities)
- CapEx and Working Capital Adjustments
- Terminal Value (Perpetuity Growth Method)
- Discount Rate Assumptions (WACC-based)
- Net Present Value (NPV) Calculations

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This is both a **personal finance lab** and a **public reference** for those learning or practicing valuation using fundamental analysis. The focus is on long-term, cash-driven valuation â€” not short-term price prediction.
